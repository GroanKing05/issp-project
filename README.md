# Introduction to Statistical Signal Processing Project – Spring 2025 (IIIT Hyderabad)

This repository contains the project files and report for the **Introduction to Statistical Signal Processing** course at IIIT Hyderabad, Spring 2025.

## Project Overview

### 1. ECG Signal Filtering using Adaptive Filters

This project focuses on filtering a noisy ECG signal using various adaptive filters in both stationary and non-stationary conditions:

- **Recursive Least Squares (RLS)**
- **Least Mean Squares (LMS)**
- **Steepest Descent Algorithm**

The goal is to analyze the performance of each filter in denoising the ECG signal under different statistical conditions.

### 2. Kalman Filter for Motion Tracking

The second problem involves applying the **Kalman filter** for tracking the motion of a vehicle from a fixed, stationary reference point. The Kalman filter is used for:

- **State Prediction**
- **Measurement Update**

This helps estimate the trajectory of the vehicle in the presence of noise and uncertainty.
